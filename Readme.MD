# Hello all we will be focusing on polynomial regression here

Problem : The problem we are trying to address is the case of salary according to the experience level for a particular role.

At first we may think its a linear regression problem description, but here we are varying salary according to the position we are hiring.

so we will try to do the predictions with both linear and polynomial regressions and plot the results.
